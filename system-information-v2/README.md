# System Information Version 2
DESCRIPTION
-
Modified system information bash script that displays the following system information on the current Linux distro: hostname, disk space, memory, uptime and active users. Rather than user input, the script utilizes flags to have the system information. Included is a displayUsage() function that lists the available flags to run the script. This script was developed on RHEL 7.6 and tested on RHEL 7.6 & Ubuntu 18.04.

This script should be able to handle other Linux distros as well.
